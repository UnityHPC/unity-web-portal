# UnityHPC Account Portal

An identity management GUI for research computing written in PHP and built on MariaDB and OpenLDAP.

Typical Usage:

- User registers an account
  - LDAP entries are created
- User manages SSH public keys
  - No passwords
  - Github import, upload file, paste, generate and download private key
- User changes login shell
- User requests to join a PI group
  - Requires PI approval
- User requests their own PI group
  - Requires admin approval
- PI approves/denies requests to join their PI group
- PI removes members from their group

Admin Features:

- Responsive Tables ([datatables.net](https://datatables.net)) for filtering, sorting, pagination, etc.
- Branding customization for multiple domains simultaneously
- Custom UIDNumber / GIDNumber mappings for specific users
- Login as another user
- Mailing

## Installation/Deployment

See the Docker Compose environment (`tools/docker-dev/`) for an (unsafe for production) example.

1. OpenLDAP server
   - Structure should be similar to `tools/docker-dev/identity/bootstrap.ldif` <!-- TODO separate OUs from entries -->
   - Also see `tools/docker-dev/identity/{config,ssh}.ldif`
   - recommended openldap modules/overlays:
     - `unique`: prevent UIDNumber, GIDNumber conflicts
     - `pw-sha2`: allow the use of sha2 password hashing algorithms for bind
1. MySQL / MariaDB server
   - Structure should be similar to `tools/docker-dev/sql/bootstrap.sql` <!-- TODO separate structure from data -->
1. SMTP server
1. Web server
   - This repository cloned
   - `deployment/config/config.ini` should be owned by the apache user (`www-data` on Ubuntu), with mode `0600`
   - Submodules checked out (`git submodule update --checkout --init`)
   - Composer (`apt install composer` on Ubuntu)
   - NodeJS
     - this is only needed because we use `npm` to manage frontend JS files like jQuery
     - (`curl -sL "https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x" | sudo bash; sudo apt update; sudo apt install nodejs` on Ubuntu)
   - Dependencies:
     - PHP extensions
       - curl, intl, ldap, mbstring, mysql, pdo, xml (`apt install php-curl php-intl php-ldap php-mbstring php-mysql php-pdo php-xml` on Ubuntu)
     - PHP Libraries
       - `COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer --no-dev --no-scripts --no-plugins install`
     - JS Libraries
       - `npm install`
       - `npx copy-files-from-to`
   - `httpd` `DocumentRoot` set to `webroot/`
   - `httpd` Authentication
     - Any authentication will do as long as it defines `REMOTE_USER`, `givenName`, `sn`, and `mail`
       - `REMOTE_USER` must take the form `username@org`
       - `givenName` is first name, `sn` is last name
     - Unity uses Shibboleth SP and the Apache Shibboleth module (`apt install shibboleth-sp-utils libapache2-mod-shib` on Ubuntu)
   - `httpd` Authorization
     - Restricted access to `webroot/admin/`
     - Global access (with valid authentication) to `webroot/`
     - No access anywhere else
1. Authorization for your other services based on user flag groups
   - in order to access your services, a user should be in the `qualified` group and should not be in the `locked`, `idlelocked`, or `disabled` groups
   - (what services you offer) and (how you implement this authorization) are out of scope

## Configuration

1. Create `deployment/config/config.ini` using `/deployment/defaults/config.ini` as a reference
   - Make sure this file is not world readable!
1. If using mulitple domains, create `deployment/overrides/<domain>/config/config.ini`
1. If using custom UIDNumber/GIDNumber mappings, create `deployment/custom_user_mappings/*.csv`
   - The 1st column is UID, the 2nd column is both UIDNumber and GIDNumber
1. Add logos to `webroot/assets/footer_logos/`
1. Copy emails from `resources/mail` to `deployment/mail_overrides` and edit them if you wish
1. Copy pages from `resources/templates` to `deployment/templates_overrides` and edit them if you wish

## Integration

The scope of this project ends at being responsible for the LDAP user database. We recommend production deployments to set up scripts which detect changes in LDAP and then perform further actions. For example, Unity uses such scripts to create home directories and add records to the Slurm account database.

## Updating

We recommend a deployment where each version of the portal is its own clone, then just change a symlink to point to the new version. This way a rollback is much easier.

Example folder structure, where `->` indicates a symlink:

```
/srv/www/
    unity-web-portal -> unity-web-portal-1.1.0
    unity-web-portal-1.1.0
    unity-web-portal-1.2.0
```

Update instructions assuming the above structure:

```shell
url="https://..."
prod="/srv/www/unity-web"
old="/srv/www/unity-web-1.1.0"
new="/srv/www/unity-web-1.2.0"

mkdir "$new" && cd "$new"
git clone "$url" .
git submodule update --init --checkout
COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer --no-dev --no-scripts --no-plugins install
npm install
npx copy-files-from-to
cp --preserve=all "$prod/deployment/config/config.ini" ./deployment/config/config.ini
rsync -a "$prod/deployment/custom_user_mappings/" ./deployment/custom_user_mappings/
rsync -a "$prod/deployment/overrides/" ./deployment/overrides/
rsync -a "$prod/webroot/assets/footer_logos/" ./footer_logos/
rsync -a "$prod/deployment/mail_overrides/" ./deployment/mail_overrides/
rsync -a "$prod/deployment/templates_overrides/" ./deployment/templates_overrides/
rm "$prod" && ln -s "$PWD" "$prod"
```

Rollback:

```shell
rm "$prod" && ln -s "$old" "$prod"
```

### Version-specific update instructions:

### 1.6 -> 1.7

- the `update-qualified-users-group.php` worker should be executed
  - this may remove a large number of users from your qualified users group
- the `pages` SQL table should be droppped
  - the `home` page can be copied over to `deployment/templates_overrides/home.php`
  - the `support` page should be moved over to wherever you host your documentation
- the `notices` SQL table should be droppped
- a new LDAP schema needs to be added:
  ```shell
  scp tools/docker-dev/identity/account-portal-schema.ldif root@your-ldap-server:/root/account-portal-schema.ldif
  ssh root@your-ldap-server ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f /root/account-portal-schema.ldif
  ```
- the objectClass `piGroup` needs to be added to all your PI groups
  ```shell
  ./workers/ensure-all-pi-groups-have-objectClass.php
  ```
- the `[ldap]group_ou` option has been renamed to `[ldap]usergroup_ou`
- the `[ldap]user_flag_groups[ghost]` group has been renamed to `[ldap]user_flag_groups[disabled]`
- 3 new colors `danger` `danger_hover` `danger_disabled` should be added to the branding config

### 1.5 -> 1.6

- the `[site]getting_started_url` option should be defined
- the `[ldap]admin_group` option has been renamed to `[ldap]user_flag_groups[admin]`
- the `[ldap]qualified_user_group` option has been renamed to `[ldap]user_flag_groups[qualified]`
- the `user_qualified`, `user_dequalified` mail templates have been removed
- the `user_flag_added`, `user_flag_removed` mail templates have been added (`qualified` is one of the flags)

### 1.4 -> 1.5

- Redis can be shut down
- the `[redis]` portion of your config file should be removed

### 1.3 -> 1.4

- the `[ldap]user_group` option has been renamed to `[ldap]qualified_user_group`
- the `user_created ` mail template has been renamed to `user_qualified`
- the `user_dequalified` mail template has been added

In v1.2.1, we extended PI group requests and PI group join requests to store user info like name and email.
This was necessary because LDAP entries were not created for users until they became "qualified" (become a PI or joined a PI group).
While a user was unqualified, if the Redis cache was cleared, the user info would be lost.
Now, LDAP entries are created immediately for every user, so this is no longer necessary.

- Shut down the web portal
  ```shell
  systemctl stop apache2
  ```
- Create LDAP entries for all existing requests
  ```php
  use UnityWebPortal\lib\UnityUser;
  $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] = "worker"; // see deployment/overrides/worker/
  $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] = "127.0.0.1";
  require_once __DIR__ . "/../resources/autoload.php";
  foreach ($SQL->getAllRequests() as $request) {
    $user = new UnityUser($request["uid"], $LDAP, $SQL, $MAILER, $WEBHOOK);
    if (!$user->exists()) {
      echo "creating user: " . jsonEncode($request) . "\n";
      $user->init(
        $request["firstname"],
        $request["lastname"],
        $request["email"],
        $request["org"],
      );
    }
  }
  ```
- Remove columns from the `requests` table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE `requests`
  DROP COLUMN `firstname`,
  DROP COLUMN `lastname`,
  DROP COLUMN `email`,
  DROP COLUMN `org`;
  ```
- Update the portal PHP code following the normal procedure
- Start the portal again
  ```shell
  systemctl start apache2
  ```

### 1.2 -> 1.3

- SQL:
  - remove the `sitevars` table
- `defaults/config.ini.default` has some new fields that need to be overriden:
  - `offset_UIDGID`
  - `offset_PIGID`
  - `offset_ORGGID`
- `custom_user_mappings` can no longer match with just the 1st segment of the logged in user's UID, an exact match is required
- LDAP:
  - create the `gecos` attribute for all users by concatenating `givenName` and `sn`

### 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1

- SQL:
  - Add new columns to the `requests` table:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `requests`
    ADD `firstname` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `timestamp`,
    ADD `lastname` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `firstname`,
    ADD `email` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `lastname`,
    ADD `org` VARCHAR(768) NOT NULL AFTER `email`;
    ```

### 1.1 -> 1.2

- SQL:
  - Create the `sitevars` table (see `bootstrap.sql` for details)
  - Create the `audit_log` table (see `bootstrap.sql` for details)
  - Create the `account_deletion_requests` table (see `bootstrap.sql` for details)
  - Create the `user_last_logins` table (see `bootstrap.sql` for details)
  - Drop the `sso_log` table
  - Drop the `events` table
  - Reduce the size of all `varchar(1000)` columns to `varchar(768)`
  - Delete the `priv` row in the `pages` table (if moving site policy to external site)
  - Add the `account_policy` row in the `pages` table (if NOT moving site policy to external site)
- `defaults/config.ini.default` has some new fields that may need to be overriden:
  - `ldap.user_group`
  - `site.terms_of_service_url`
    - example, created account policy page: `https://unity.rc.umass.edu/panel/account_policy.php`
  - `site.account_policy_url`
    - example, using old site policy page: `https://unity.rc.umass.edu/panel/priv.php`
- LDAP:
  - Create a new group defined by `ldap.user_group` in the config

### 1.0 -> 1.1

- SQL:
  - Add the `home` content management row
- `config/branding/config.ini.default` has some new fields that may need to be overriden:
  - `mail.pi_approve*`
  - `page.home`
  - The entire `loginshell` section
