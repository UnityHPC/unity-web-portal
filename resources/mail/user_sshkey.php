<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
You have modified the SSH keys on your Unity account. These public keys are currently available:
</p>

<?php foreach ($data["keys"] as $key) {
    echo "<pre>$key</pre>";
} ?>

<p>
You can view the SSH public keys attached to your account on the
<?php echo getHyperlink("account settings", "/panel/account.php"); ?>
page.
</p>

<p>If you believe this to be a mistake, please reply to this email as soon as possible.</p>
