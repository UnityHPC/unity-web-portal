# Contributing to the UnityHPC Platform Account Portal

## Conventions

- PHP version 8.3.
- All PHP files are required to be linted with PSR-12 and formatted with `phpcbf`.
  - Note: Some changes have been made to PSR-12, see `.phpcs-ruleset-pure.php`
- All pure PHP files are required to be formatted with Prettier as well as above.
- The maximum line length for any pure PHP file is 100 characters.
- Comments should be used sparingly.
- Empty lines should be used sparingly.
- No code should call `die()` or `exit()`, instead `UnityHTTPD::die()`.
  - This will avoid the premature death of our automated testing processes.
- No code should call `assert()`, instead `\ensure()`.
  - This will enforce conditions even in production.
- No code should fail quietly, instead exceptions should be thrown. PHP builtin functions that fail quietly (ex: `json_encode`) should be replaced with a wrapper in `resources/utils.php`. See `test/assert-utils-used.bash` for a list of wrappers.
- `UnityHTTPD`'s user-facing error functionality (ex: `badRequest`) should only be called from `webroot/**/*.php`.
  `resources/**/*.php` should throw exceptions instead.
- all pages under `webroot/admin/` must check for `$USER->getFlag(UserFlag::ADMIN)` and call `UnityHTTPD::forbidden()` if not admin.
- All these conventions should be enforced with `pre-commit` / github CI if possible

### Caching

There are two primary methods of caching: session and cookies.
Cookies are good because it gives the user control, but a cookie value can never be trusted, and no sensitive data can be written to a cookie.
Session is good because it can be trusted and sensitive data can be written to it, but in the event of stale cache, the only fix is to wait a while until the session is automatically cleared.

Here are some examples:

- `pi_search.php` (session)
  - needs to search through the results of an LDAP query every time the user presses a key in a search box
  - value does not need to be trusted
  - cannot use a cookie because that would give the user the names and emails of every PI
  - stale cache is avoided because the value is updated every time you load the page

- `OPERATOR`, `OPERATOR_IP` (session)
  - written to audit log
  - value is trusted
  - stale cache is avoided because the value is updated every time you load any page

- CSRF tokens (session)
  - value is trusted

- `navbar_pi_gids` (cookies)
  - the navbar on every page needs to know the list of PI groups with an owner that has the same email address as the current user
  - value does not need to be trusted, since `pi.php` enforces its own authorization
  - stale cache cannot be avoided

### Environment Usage

While the environment is running, the following is accessible:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000 - Account Portal
- http://127.0.0.1:8010 - PHPLDAPAdmin Portal
- http://127.0.0.1:8020 - PHPMyAdmin Portal
- http://127.0.0.1:8030 - Mailcatcher Portal

### Test Users

The test environment ships with a number of users that can be used for testing.
When accessing locked down portions of the portal, you will be asked for a username and password.
The password is always `password`. `tools/docker-dev/web/htpasswd` contains all valid usernames.

Notable users:

- `user1@org1.test` - admin, PI
- `user2@org1.test` - blank user
- `user4@org1.test` - normal user in PI group
- `user5@org2.test` - PI with no group members
- `user2000@org2.test` - user never before seen

### Changes to Dev Environment

Should the default schema change, the `ldap/bootstrap.ldif` and `sql/bootstrap.sql` must be updated for the LDAP server and the MySQL server, respectively.

## Testing

Github Actions are used to execute all following tests for all pull requests.
This means that if you're feeling lazy, you don't have to go out of your way to run tests, you just have to wait a bit longer for Github to do it for you.

### `pre-commit`

We use `pre-commit` for enforcing (and sometimes automatically fixing) the PSR-12 code standard, whitespace discrepancies, syntax validity, secret leak detection, and whatever else can be done quickly.
`pre-commit` runs automatically every time you commit, assuming you set it up correctly.
To save time, `pre-commit` only runs on the files with staged changes.
To run on all files, use `pre-commit run --all-files`.

### `phpunit`

Since this codebase was not written with testing in mind, and this codebase makes extensive use of external resources such as SQL and LDAP, most of our testing does not focus on isolated "units", but high level functionality.
Our functional tests pretend to make HTTP requests by modifying global variables in the same way that a production webserver would.
This is preferred over directly calling library code because it helps to test the PHP logic in the webpages themselves, rather than just the internals.
For example, one functional test would be to set `$_SERVER["REMOTE_USER"]` to authenticate as a user, `require "resources/init.php"` to setup the `$USER` global variable, set `$_POST["key"] = "ssh-rsa ..."` and `require "webroot/panel/account.php"` to make that user enter a new SSH key in the HTML form in the `account.php` page.
Once a user action has been taken, internal interfaces are used to verify the results.

To run `phpunit`, spawn 2 shells in differnt tabs:

tab 1:

```shell
cd ./tools/docker-dev
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

tab 2:

```
$ container="$(docker container ls | grep web | awk '{print $1}')"
$ docker exec -it "$container" bash
> cd /var/www/unity-web
> ./vendor/bin/phpunit /path/to/tests
```

For `/path/to/tests/`, you usually want `./test/functional/` but you can select a specific file to save time when troubleshooting specific tests.

Note: To enhance the stack traces in `phpunit`'s output, pipe the output to `./test/phpunit-markup.php`.

### code coverage

`phpunit` has code coverage built in.
It recommends the use of "strict code coverage", where every single test explicitly lists what functions it covers.
That's a lot of work, so instead we accept what phpunit refers to as "risky unintentionally covered code".
Using [robiningelbrecht/phpunit-coverage-tools](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/phpunit-coverage-tools), our Github Actions testing will fail if the coverage falls below a certain percentage of lines of code.
This percentage should be increased over time to just below whatever the current coverage is.

To run a code coverage test, use the same procedure for phpunit but add this argument: `--coverage-text=/dev/stdout`

### LDAP cleanliness

Any test that makes changes to LDAP must clean up after itself using `try`/`finally`.
When a test fails to clean up after itself, it can cause other tests to fail or become otherwise un-useful.
Because LDAP may not always be clean, any test that relies on a certain LDAP state should `assert` everything about that state.
To reset LDAP to a clean slate, just re-run the `build.sh` script.

Note: `phpunit` can misbehave when using `expectException` and `try`/`finally`, see https://github.com/UnityHPC/unity-web-portal/issues/258.

### creating the conditions for a test

There are many user conditions available which are selected using the `$nickname` argument to the `switchUser` function.
Examples: `"Blank"`, `"NormalPI"`, `"EmptyPIGroupOwner"`.
See `phpunit-bootstrap.php` for more information.

The LDAP entries available in the dev environment are defined in `tools/docker-dev/identity/bootstrap.ldif`.
These entries may be subject to change.
Only `phpunit-bootstrap.php` should have hard-coded references to these entries.

### testing the HTTP API

When writing a test, it may be tempting to use the PHP API directly, but the HTTP API must also be tested.

Example:

using the PHP API:

```php
private function requestGroupCreation()
{
    $USER->getPIGroup()->requestGroup();
}
```

using the HTTP API:

```php
private function requestGroupCreation()
{
    http_post(
        __DIR__ . "/../../webroot/panel/new_account.php",
        ["new_user_sel" => "pi", "eula" => "agree", "confirm_pi" => "agree"]
    );
}
```

`http_post` is defined in `phpunit-bootstrap.php`.

It is fine to use the PHP API when making assertions and doing cleanup.
